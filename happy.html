            First and foremost, ILOVEYOU ILOVEYOU ILOVEYOU, Thank you for being the most wonderful and 
            amazing girlfriend a person could ask for. You're my confidant, my cheerleader, my safe 
            place, my home. You always know how to make me smile even though it seems impossible. You 
            were always there to celebrate my wins, and to hold my hand when everything gets tough. 
            You're thoughtful, kindness and your cuteness make me in love with you even more. Your love 
            is a gift I cherish every day.

            And then there's your dedication to nursing.  I see how hard you work, how passionate you are 
            about helping others, and how determined you are to succeed.  Nursing is a demanding field as 
            well as pressure, both physically and emotionally, and you handle it with compassion. You're 
            going to be an amazing nurse baby, and I do not doubt that you'll make a real difference in 
            the lives of so many people for how sincere you are.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            I know life hasn't always been that friendly for you. You've faced challenges that would knock 
            most people down, but you always rise stronger.  Your strength, and courage to keep continuing 
            with life even though it keeps throwing rocks at you are truly admirable.  You inspire and never 
            fail to amaze me every day with your ability to overcome obstacles and keep moving forward with 
            such positivity.  Never forget how incredibly strong you are.
        </p>
            
        <p>

            the happiness, joy, and love that you deserve. I'm grateful for your presence in my life, and 
            I can't wait to see what the future holds for us especially you. I'm wishing a happy birthday, 
            my babii. I love you more than any words that a poet can create.
